## Contributing To The Core

### Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. In fact you don't even need to know a programming language or to be able to check the code itself, you just need to make sure that everything works as expected and [submit an issue report](https://github.com/gelform/kanban/issues/new) if you spot a bug. Sound like something you're up for? Go for it!

#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help us fix it by submitting an issue report:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/gelform/kanban/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there
* Submit a report for your issue
  * Clearly describe the issue (including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug)
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

### Making Changes

Making changes to the core is a key way to help us improve the plugin. You will need some technical skills to make a change, like knowing a bit of PHP, CSS, SASS or JavaScript.

If you think something could be improved and you're able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request. We'll be pleased to get it :)

#### How To Submit A PR

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).**
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy Windows line endings please :)
* When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the plugin repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by plugin developers
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by the lead developer.


After you follow the step above, the next stage will be waiting on us to merge your Pull Request. We review them all, and make suggestions and changes as and if necessary.
